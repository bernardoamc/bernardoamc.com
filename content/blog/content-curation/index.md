We live in an age where it has never been easier to have access to content about
pretty much every subject of interest to us. This is changing the way we reason
about our education system, relationships and ultimately society itself.

Seeing this through the lenses of centralization/decentralization we
realize that our world has been slowly moving towards a decentralized
structure for content creation and sharing. Social media and search engines
have allowed us to reach a wider audience that previously was only possible
through mainstream media channels like television, newspapers or magazines.

This shift from content as a _scarce_ resource to an _abundance_ of content changes
the way we derive status from it. For example, would you gain status by reading and
commenting on something that everyone else can also read and comment for free?
Probably not if you don't have anything _to add_ to the discussion. But what if
you could? Enters _quality_.

This shift from _scarcity_ as a way to achieve status to _quality_ as a way to
achieve status has been both fascinating and challenging to me as
someone who likes to learn new things constantly. New initiatives like
non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are emerging to adapt scarcity and funding to our
digital world, but let's leave that topic aside for a future post.

So, what are my challenges? To put it in simple terms, it has become incredibly
hard to know what to read in order to learn something. What are the best
resources? How do I know if something is accurate? We have moved from a scarcity
of resources to a _resource overload_.

Is this a bigger problem than what we had before? Does it warrant moving back towards
a centralized model? Of course not, but _some degree of centralization_ is
needed, and that's when content curation and curators enter the picture. Having
_an abundance_ of content curated by specialists brings the right tension of
centralization versus descentralization to the picture and generates
_value_ to someone that is trying to learn more from a certain area or industry.

Tracing a parallel from the delivery industry, in order to
serve a _limited audience_ well the industry has been moving from centralized
fulfillments centers to micro fulfillment centers. Curators are the micro
fulfillment centers of specialized knowledge. They serve a limited audience, but
they do it well. Universities and newspapers would be our centralized
fulfillments centers in this case, with a one-size fits all approach to a
_broader_ audience.

Content curators have the tough job of trying to find and appeal to an audience
that can derive value from their expertise. Interestingly enough we already have
people ready to fill this role, the same people responsible for our content
overload problem, creators.

Strong creators already have the trust of a limited audience, they also have an
open communication channel through their own creations in order to promote this
service. The next step involves creating and moderating communities where people
can derive value from each other. Good examples of this new shift towards
communities being formed from content curation are
[Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/subscribe)
or [The Generalist](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/).

The near future should bring even more curators across industries, with the
biggest ones forming communities and doing collabs. This added value will be
monetized in different forms, from premium content to courses or events. How far
can we push this concept before a new push towards decentralization arrives?
