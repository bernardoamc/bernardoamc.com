Ask ten companies what are the responsibilities of a Vulnerability Management team and you will get twelve different answers. Regardless, despite having distinct team compositions or responsibilities, Vulnerability Management teams tend to fall into similar traps when operating.

## Development

Vulnerability Management teams can learn a lot from how successful product teams operate. Let's see some common mistakes in this area.

### Tackling a new surface area

It is a common mistake for a Vulnerability Management team to spend an unreasonable amount of time in order to identify vulnerabilities in a new surface area without considering _where most of the risk_ lies. Let's use Container Scanning as an example, a team could start their solution by figuring out a way to identify _every_ container being used by product teams, deriving the relationship between these containers and scanning these container for vulnerabilities. This seems simple on paper, but as development goes on we are bound to uncover unknow unknowns, and development goes on without providing value to the organization. For example, answering where a vulnerability originates from doesn't have a trivial answer when multiple container relationships are in play.

Let's pause here and ask ouselves an important question:

> Where does most of the risk lies in this particular surface area?

We can argue that most of the risk comes from _base containers that are not built by our organization_. Not only we do not control these containers, but they are also relied on to build services across the organization. With this answer in mind we can cut a lot of steps from our original solution.

- Now that we are handling base containers we don't need to worry about building a container relationship graph
- We can build an independent solution that prevents new containers from being introduced to the organization

Not only finding vulnerabilities in containers becomes easier, but we have identified a completely new way to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced in the first place. More importantly, the organization has their risk reduced much sooner.

This is similar to how the concept of a _Minimum Viable Product (MVP)_ utilized by product teams. By asking ourselves where most of the risk lies, a Vulnerability Management team can get to their MVP and reduce their risk surface area sooner. Later on, if the organization is unwilling to accept the remaining risk, the team can iterate on their solution knowing that themajority of their risk is already covered.

### Metrics

Lack of instrumentation is such a common mistake that deserves its own section.

## Reporting

### Not getting buy in from product teams

Vulnerability Management teams are always complaining about how slow product teams are at solving reported issues and how they always receive pushback or hear a "won't fix" as an answer. While frustrating, we can improve this situation by fixing some common mistakes.



--------------------------

A Vulnerability Management team aiming to solve

In its simplest form this cycle can be represented in four steps:

1. Identification
    - Tooling, Feeds, Manual, Bug Bounty
2. Evaluation
    - CVE, CVSS, EPSS, CWE
3. Action
    - Patching, Reporting, Escalating
4. Verification
    - Monitoring

Attemptin



Successful vulnerability management teams are able to solve problems using a _risk based approach_. 

Being tied to a single tool.

Not taking into account how product teams operate.

Not reducing noise.

Not providing the right level of support.

Not tracking progress for each program.

Not having enough metrics.
